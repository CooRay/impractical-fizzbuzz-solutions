# Recursive
A recursive solution to FizzBuzz.

## Cons
* Depending on your JS implementation, the stack could blow up (if you don't have tail call optimization)
* It's probably not as straight forward for most developers

## Pros
* It'll be easy for me to port this to Erlang :)

## What the hell is wrong with you?
Lots of things...
