# recursive
A solution to the FizzBuzz problem using recursion

## Cons
 - more complicated
 - more resource consuming since array shifting need to be done everytime

## Pros
 - I have no idea of what is the benefit of using recursion for this kind of scenario, it looks cooler maybe ? improve logical thinking ?

## What the hell is wrong with you?
I dunno, man.
