A solution to the FizzBuzz problem using basic control-flow constructs.

## Cons
 - The same condition is explicitly checked multiple times.
 - If a new pattern is to be checked, it has to be checked in multiple places.
 - The number of checks that must be performed grows exponentially. i.e. the number of checks can be found by using the formula `p(c) = wÂ² - 1` where `c` is the number of conditions you need to check for.

## Pros
 - Super readable and fast to type.
 - Proves that you understand basic control flow and precedence.
