# Ternary Madness
Clearly, the problem with most FizzBuzz implementations is the duplicated array.push (or console.log) calls.  Ternaries reduce the duplication by taking away any ability to quickly understand what the code is doing.  That sounds like a huge win!

## Cons
* Readability

## Pros
* Less duplication than some implementations

## What the hell is wrong with you?
Lots of things...
