# Mega Expression
Nested ternary expressions can hurt code readability, but I still want a 1-liner.  I've got it, and/or are expressions.  I can use those to eliminate unwanted if/else or ternaries!

## Cons
* Readability
* I imagine certain parts of my keyboard will wear out faster than others with solutions like this

## Pros
* None?

## What the hell is wrong with you?
Lots of things...
